    <h2 class="bio-text">BIOGRAPHY</h2>
    <p class="bio-para">
     I’m a self taught Frontend Developer, UI/UX Designer, qualified Filmmaker, and Graphic Designer driven by a passion for crafting digital experiences that are as functional as they are visually captivating.<br><br>

My creative journey began in filmmaking, where I learned the power of storytelling, how to evoke emotion, pace a narrative, and build meaning through visuals. That foundation naturally evolved into graphic design, where I sharpened my eye for detail, composition, and brand identity.<br><br>

Today, I fuse these creative disciplines with technical expertise in frontend development and user-centered design to build intuitive, responsive, and visually compelling digital products. From concept to execution, my goal is to blend artistry and technology in ways that connect, inspire, and drive results.<br><br>

Over the past few years, I’ve developed a versatile skill set spanning:<br><br>

 1. Web design and development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive UI frameworks)<br>

2. E-commerce and digital management (Shopify, Wix Studio, WordPress, Takealot Supplier Portal, Amazon Vendor Central)<br>

3. Brand identity, motion graphics, and visual storytelling<br>

4. Content strategy, marketing design, and performance analysis<br><br>

This blend of creativity, strategy, and technical execution allows me to bridge the gap between design, development, and digital business operations delivering solutions that look beautiful and work seamlessly.<br><br>

As a lifelong learner, I stay curious about emerging technologies and design trends, constantly exploring how innovation can shape how people experience brands and digital products. My mission is simple: to help brands and creators tell their stories, elevate their presence, and build meaningful digital connections through thoughtful, impactful design.<br><br>
