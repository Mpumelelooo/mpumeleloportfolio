 <div class="biography">
  <h2 class="bio-text">BIOGRAPHY</h2>
  <p class="bio-para">
    I’m a self-taught Frontend Developer, UI/UX Designer, and a qualified Filmmaker and Graphic Designer with a passion for building digital experiences that are as functional as they are visually captivating.

    My creative journey began in filmmaking, where I developed a deep understanding of narrative, pacing, and emotional impact. That foundation evolved into a love for graphic design, where I honed my eye for detail, composition, and brand aesthetics. Today, I combine these creative strengths with technical expertise in frontend development and user-centered design to craft intuitive, responsive, and engaging digital products.
    
    Over the past few years, I’ve built a versatile skill set—ranging from website management and e-commerce integration to brand identity, content creation, and data analysis. I'm also proficient in platforms like Wix Studio, Takealot Supplier Portal, and Amazon Vendor Central, allowing me to bridge the gap between design, development, and digital operations.
    
    As a lifelong learner, I stay up to date with emerging technologies and design trends. I’m passionate about helping brands and individuals tell their stories, elevate their presence, and build meaningful connections through thoughtful, innovative solutions.
